Notes:

This directory is here because XCode cannot handle optional static libraries linking so we must stub some library, tunnel for instance.

You can regenerate dummy.c (which is an empty file...) using:


	for arch in arm64 armv7 i386 x86_64; do
    	 clang -c dummy.c -o dummy-$arch.a -arch $arch
	done
	lipo -create -output libdummy.a dummy-*.a
